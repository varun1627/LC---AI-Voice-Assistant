Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and decided to see a doctor. After a thorough examination, the doctor diagnosed me with [illness name] and advised me to take complete rest for at least [number of days] days.

I regret any inconvenience this may cause to the team, and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work once I return to the office. If there are any urgent tasks that need to be completed in my absence, please let me know, and I will do my best to assist from home.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
