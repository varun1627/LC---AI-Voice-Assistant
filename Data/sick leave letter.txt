Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and have been advised by a medical professional to take a few days off to recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am back. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know when I expect to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Varun Kumar
