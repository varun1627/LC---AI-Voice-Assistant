Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and decided to consult a doctor. After a thorough examination, I was diagnosed with [insert medical condition].

As per my doctor's advice, I need to take complete bed rest for the next few days to recover completely. I will be taking the prescribed medication and will ensure that I am back to work as soon as possible.

In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you could arrange for someone to cover my duties during my absence. I will be checking my emails periodically and will respond to any urgent queries.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused and assure you that I will make up for the lost time once I have recovered.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
